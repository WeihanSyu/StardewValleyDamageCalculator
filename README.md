# Stardew Valley Weapon Damage Calculator
## Summary 
* Created a web app to calculate and display the weapon damage stats from the game "Stardew Valley" based on the bonuses that a user selects.
* The website can be accessed here [Stardew Valley Weapon Damage Calculator](https://weihansyu.github.io/StardewValleyDamageCalculator/web%20server%20files/)

## Note regarding branches and changing weapon data
* The **master** branch contains the project built on a PHP file which collects data from a SQL Server backend during runtime to get weapon info.
* Since I chose GitHub Pages to host my web app, I created a pure HTML/CSS & JavaScript branch for the static site -> branch_name = **zero_php**
